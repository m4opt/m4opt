Dorado
======

Dorado is a concept for an ultraviolet telescope on a small satellite designed
for target-of-opportunity follow-up of gravitational-wave events. Here are some
key statistics about the baseline design.

:Field of View:             7.1° x 7.1° square
:Central Wavelength:        195 nm
:Orbit:                     625 km circular sun-synchronous LEO
:Readout Overhead:          0 s [#f1]_
:Maximum Slew Velocity:     0.872° s\ :sup:`-1`
:Maximum Slew Acceleration: 0.244° s\ :sup:`-2`

..  todo:: Specify effective area curve, pixel scale, sharpness of PSF.

Objective
---------

The Dorado science operations center receives a gravitational-alert that
includes the time of the event and a 3D localization map providing the
probability density function of the location of the source as a function of
right ascension, declination, and luminosity distance.

..  todo:: Pick a specific example time and localization.

A model kilonova light curve gives the predicted luminosity of the source in
the Dorado band as a function of time. The Dorado threshold for detection is
modeled using the CCD S/N equation for PSF photometry, including attentuation
of the source due to spatially varying Galactic dust extinction and sky noise
due to spatially varying Galactic, zodiacal, and airglow backgrounds.

..  todo:: Pick model light curve. Elaborate on dust extinction and sky
    background.

Dorado must choose fields to observe from a fixed set of reference pointings in
order to simplify data processing (image subtraction). The set of reference
pointings should be designed to efficiently cover the entire sky without
excessive overlap. The reference pointing grid should be designed as part of
this example problem.

Dorado's objective is to plan up to 2 orbits of observations in order to
maximize the probability of detecting the source at least twice with S/N≥5.

Decision Variables
------------------

The decision variables consist of:

*   The number of observations
*   For each observation:
    -   Its pointing
    -   Its start time
    -   Its exposure time

Constraints
-----------

Dorado observations are subject to the following constraints:

*   The telescope must point:

    -   At least 28° from any part of the Earth directly illuminated by the Sun
    -   At least 6° from the Earth limb
    -   At least 46° from the center of the Sun
    -   At least 23° from the center of the Moon
    -   At least 10° from the Galactic plane

*   The trapped particle flux at the position of the spacecraft (estimated for
    solar maximum conditions) is:

    -   ≤1 cm\ :sup:`-2` s\ :sup:`-1` for protons with energies ≥20 MeV
    -   ≤100 cm\ :sup:`-2` s\ :sup:`-1` for electrons with energies ≥1 MeV


..  [#f1] Dorado has a frame transfer CCD. One image can be read out while the
    CCD is collecting photons for the next image, so there is no readout
    overhead between exposures.

Pseudocode
----------

.. code-block:: python

    from astropy import units as u
    import m4opt

    # Factory method or subclass?
    observer = m4opt.Observer.in_orbit('path/to/ephemeris.tle')

    observer.constraints += [
        m4opt.constraints.TrappedParticleFluxConstraint(
            flux=1*u.cm**-2*u.s**-1, energy=20*u.MeV,
            particle='p', solar='max'),
        m4opt.constraints.TrappedParticleFluxConstraint(
            flux=100*u.cm**-2*u.s**-1, energy=1*u.MeV,
            particle='e', solar='max'),
        m4opt.constraints.SunSeparationConstraint(46 * u.deg),
        m4opt.constraints.MoonSeparationConstraint(6 * u.deg),
        m4opt.constraints.GalacticLatitudeConstraint(10 * u.deg)
    ]
