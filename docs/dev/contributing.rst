Code formatting
---------------

This project uses `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com>`_ to automatically check
and fix code formatting each time that you make a commit. Before preparing a
pull request, please install pre-commit and configure it by running the
following commands once while in the directory where you have cloned the source
code::

    $ pip install pre-commit
    $ pre-commit install
