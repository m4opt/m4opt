   Visualization of an example observing plan generated by |M4OPT| for the `UVEX <https://www.uvex.caltech.edu>`_ mission.

|M4OPT| is an open-source toolkit for multi-facility scheduling of astrophysics
observing campaigns. It focuses on extremely rapid follow-up of gravitational
wave (GW) and neutrino events with heterogeneous networks of space and
ground-based observatories.

|M4OPT| uses the versatile mathematical framework of `mixed integer
programming`__ to model and solve complex observation scheduling problems.
Although |M4OPT| is open source, for the largest problems it can leverage two
industrial-strength commercial MIP solvers: `CPLEX`__ or `Gurobi`__. Both
solvers are available for free for academic users.

|M4OPT| is designed from the `Astropy affiliated pacakge`__ template, and is
meant to follow those standards, including interoperability with the
`Astropy`__ ecosystem. It also complies with `NASA Procedural Requirements
(NPR) 7150`__ for `Class C software`__ and is suitable for non-safety-critical
ground software applications for `Class D NASA payloads`__.
