|M4OPT|: Multi-Mission Multi-Messenger Observation Planning Toolkit
###################################################################

|M4OPT| is an open-source toolkit for multi-facility scheduling of astrophysics
observing campaigns. It focuses on extremely rapid follow-up of gravitational
wave (GW) and neutrino events with heterogeneous networks of space and
ground-based observatories.

|M4OPT| uses the versatile mathematical framework of `mixed integer
programming`_ (MIP) to model and solve complex observation scheduling problems.
Although |M4OPT| is open source, for the largest problems it can leverage two
industrial-strength commercial MIP solvers: `CPLEX`_ or `Gurobi`_. Both solvers
are available for free for academic users.

|M4OPT| is designed from the `Astropy affiliated pacakge`_ template, and is 
meant to follow those standards, including interoperability with
the `Astropy`_ ecosystem. It also complies with `NASA Procedural Requirements
(NPR) 7150 <NPR 7150.2C>`_ for `Class C software <NPR 7150.2C software
classifications>`_ and is suitable for non-safety-critical ground software
applications for `Class D NASA payloads <NPR 8705.4A>`_.
