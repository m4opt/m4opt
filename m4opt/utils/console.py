"""Utilites for console applications and text user interfaces.

Use the :meth:`progress` and :meth:`status` methods to create live feedback
for a nested series of tasks. The elapsed time is shown for each task, along
with whether it completed successfully or failed due to an exception being
raised.

Examples
--------

.. code:: python
