Validation of Cerenkov Emission Calculation
==========================================

The file ``Cerenkov_output.xml`` contains the Cerenkov emission output generated by the MATLAB function ``Cerenkov``
from the `MAATv2 AstroPack <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/128984-astropack-maatv2>`_.
This XML file includes the Cerenkov emission spectrum for the material ``SiO2_suprasil_2a``,
computed using the daily electron flux (DailyMax) at the 95th percentile, as provided by the MATLAB implementation.

In our tests, we use this XML file as a reference to validate the Python implementation of the Cerenkov emission calculation.
The validation compares the Python output to the MATLAB reference for both the wavelength grid and the intensity values (``IntAA``),
ensuring consistency to within 4% relative difference across all wavelengths.


.. note::

   The Python implementation uses physical constants and units directly from the `astropy` package,
   ensuring full precision and consistency with standard values. In contrast, the MATLAB implementation
   from MAATv2 sometimes uses hardcoded or rounded values for certain physical constants (e.g.,
   the electron mass, the fine-structure constant, etc.).
