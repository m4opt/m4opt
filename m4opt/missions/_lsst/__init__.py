`LSST <https://rubinobservatory.org/>`_ is a ground-based optical survey telescope 
located in Chile as part of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. It is designed 
to conduct a 10-year survey of the southern sky with a large field of view 
to detect transient events, including potential gravitational wave counterparts 
(:footcite `2019ApJ...873..111I`).

The LSST camera's focal plane consists of 189 detectors arranged in 21 rafts, 
each containing a :math:`3 \times 3` CCD, placed in a :math:`5 \times 5` grid, 
as shown in `Figure 12  from :footcite:`2019ApJ...873..111I`.
