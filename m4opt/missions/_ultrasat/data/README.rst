Sky Grid
--------

ULTRASAT includes two predefined sky grids:

- **All-Sky Survey (ALLSS) grid**: Used during the first 6 months of the mission. Overlapping 7° fields ensure no point on the sky is farther than 7° from a grid center.

- **Low-Cadence Survey (LCS) grid** : 240 non-overlapping fields (7° radius) covering the entire sky, used for the low-cadence extragalactic survey.
  Each field includes visibility annotations (180-day or 45-day periods) and average UV extinction.

Both grids are based on the baseline survey strategy discussed within the ULTRASAT Working Groups
(https://www.weizmann.ac.il/ultrasat/for-scientists/working-groups/working-groups).
