Sky Grid
--------

The ULTRASAT sky grid includes 240 non-overlapping fields (7 radius) covering the entire sky
for the low-cadence extragalactic survey. Each field is annotated with continuous visibility
for at least one 180-day or 45-day period per year, and average UV extinction.

The grid is based on the baseline survey strategy discussed within the ULTRASAT Working Groups
(`https://www.weizmann.ac.il/ultrasat/for-scientists/working-groups/working-groups <https://www.weizmann.ac.il/ultrasat/for-scientists/working-groups/working-groups>`_).
